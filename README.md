# Analysis of the Water Level Variation in the Polish Part of the Vistula Lagoon 

This project was the data analysis and visualization part for paper [Analysis of the Water Level Variation in the Polish Part of the Vistula Lagoon (Baltic Sea) and Estimation ofWater Inflow and Outflow Transport through the Strait of Baltiysk in the Years 2008–2017](https://doi.org/10.3390/w13101328). The outcomes of the analyses are described in detail in the paper.
